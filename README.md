# Behavioural-analytics-and-user-segmentation
This project performs behavioral analytics and user segmentation using Python. It analyzes user interactions to identify patterns, segment users into meaningful groups, and build actionable profiles for targeted marketing and personalized experiences.

This project focuses on Behavioral Analytics and User Segmentation using Python. It aims to analyze user interaction patterns, identify distinct user groups, and create actionable user profiles that enable personalized marketing, improved customer service, and data-driven product strategies.

🎯 Project Objective
To leverage behavioral data to:
Understand user habits and preferences.
Group users into meaningful segments.
Enable targeted marketing campaigns and product recommendations.

🔍 Process Overview
Objective Definition
Clarify the business goal: customer personalization, churn prevention, ad targeting, etc.
Data Collection
Collect behavioral and demographic data from user activity logs, transactions, and interactions.
Feature Engineering
Extract relevant user-level features: frequency, recency, average spend, etc.
Normalize and prepare data for clustering.
Segmentation Techniques
Apply unsupervised learning (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering) to divide users into distinct segments.
User Profiling
Summarize each segment’s behavior to build interpretable user profiles (e.g., “High-value but infrequent buyer”).

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

Clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN, etc.)

Data preprocessing and visualization techniques

📈 Outcome
By combining behavioral analytics with machine learning, the project provides strategic insights into user segments, empowering businesses to act on personalized recommendations and data-driven marketing.
